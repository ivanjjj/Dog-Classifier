## Proposal
Create a dog breed classifier that can be deployed for us on a mobile or web app.

### Domain Background
There are thousands of dog breeds all over the world many which are easily recognisable and also many variations of each breed. There are already existing classifiers available for use using a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network), however many of the applications are built for adult use. I would like to make the resulting classifier available for a younger audience to use as an educational tool.

### Problem Statement
As previously mentioned, there are many different dog breeds and variations. This project aims to create an accurate classifier for common breeds using a CNN to be deployed for use on a mobile or web app.

### Datasets and Inputs
The data set that will be used for this project has been provided by Udacity and are available in the referenced links <sup>1</sup>. The dog data set, which will be used for classifying breeds, contains 3 folders each for training, test and validation sets. Each set contains a folder of photos (most have less than 10 photos) for each of the 133 dog breeds. We also have a human face data set which will be used to train a model for determining if a human face is present in a photo.

### Solution Statement
_(approx. 1 paragraph)_

In this section, clearly describe a solution to the problem. The solution should be applicable to the project domain and appropriate for the dataset(s) or input(s) given. Additionally, describe the solution thoroughly such that it is clear that the solution is quantifiable (the solution can be expressed in mathematical or logical terms) , measurable (the solution can be measured by some metric and clearly observed), and replicable (the solution can be reproduced and occurs more than once).

### Benchmark Model
_(approximately 1-2 paragraphs)_

In this section, provide the details for a benchmark model or result that relates to the domain, problem statement, and intended solution. Ideally, the benchmark model or result contextualizes existing methods or known information in the domain and problem given, which could then be objectively compared to the solution. Describe how the benchmark model or result is measurable (can be measured by some metric and clearly observed) with thorough detail.

### Evaluation Metrics
_(approx. 1-2 paragraphs)_

In this section, propose at least one evaluation metric that can be used to quantify the performance of both the benchmark model and the solution model. The evaluation metric(s) you propose should be appropriate given the context of the data, the problem statement, and the intended solution. Describe how the evaluation metric(s) are derived and provide an example of their mathematical representations (if applicable). Complex evaluation metrics should be clearly defined and quantifiable (can be expressed in mathematical or logical terms).

### Project Design
_(approx. 1 page)_

In this final section, summarize a theoretical workflow for approaching a solution given the problem. Provide thorough discussion for what strategies you may consider employing, what analysis of the data might be required before being used, or which algorithms will be considered for your implementation. The workflow and discussion that you provide should align with the qualities of the previous sections. Additionally, you are encouraged to include small visualizations, pseudocode, or diagrams to aid in describing the project design, but it is not required. The discussion should clearly outline your intended workflow of the capstone project.
